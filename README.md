# X4FoundationShaderModCodebase
Various rendering experiments for X4 Foundation. Code part.

NOTE! This mod is still very much WIP!!
NOTE!! This mods assumes you to already be playing on Ultra, since it for now adds more for the gpu to do, without looking at optimiziations of existing Egosoft render tech. 

How to install:
For the Steam version(haven't tested GoG version), put the shadergl folder directly in you X4 Foundation install folder.
For the non steam version you have to pack it with the XRCatTool's as an subst_01 in the extension folder, with it's paths pointing the same as the above steam installation.
Unfortunately the cat files if not packed lockally appears to not work. As far as I can tell this appears to be some issue in load order, where the game's load order mixes modded and vanilla shader files, causing the shaders to not compile.
If you get a black screen that never goes away or the game flat out refuses to even get the black screen, something like the above probably happened.

More to come...
