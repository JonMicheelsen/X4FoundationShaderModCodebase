# X4FoundationShaderModCodebase
Various rendering experiments for X4 Foundation. Code part.

NOTE! This mod is still very much WIP!!
NOTE!! This mods assumes you to already be playing on Ultra, since it for now adds more work for the gpu to do.

How to install:
Put the shadergl with all files and folders in it, directly in the X4 Foundation install folder and add "-prefersinglefiles" to the games launch directives, which makes the game always load the modded root folder version over its own cat packed version.
In Steam you right click the game in your library go to "Properties..." and in General you find Launch Options. That's where you add  "-prefersinglefiles"  without the quotation marks. If you run the X4_nonsteam.exe version the easiest is to make a shortcut for it and in that go right click go to properties and after the last quotation mark in the Target: path found in the Shortcut tab you add the "-prefersinglefiles"  without the quotation marks. Note when you unzip the download file from github and extract it, omit the "X4FoundationShaderModCodebase" folder it automatically generates, it needs to be the pure shadergl folder with it's content directly in the root 4X install folder!
