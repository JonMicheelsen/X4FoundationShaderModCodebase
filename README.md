# X4FoundationShaderModCodebase
Various rendering experiments for X4 Foundation. Code part.

NOTE! This mod is still very much WIP!!
NOTE!! This mods assumes you to already be playing on Ultra, since it for now adds more work for the gpu to do.

How to install:
Put the shadergl with all files and folders in it, directly in the X4 Foundation install folder and add "-prefersinglefiles" to the games lauch directives, which makes the game always load the modded version over its own version.
